# Neovim for Dev

This is a Neovim configuration based on **[NvChad](https://nvchad.com/)**. It is designed with **simplicity** in mind, extending NvChad with a curated set of plugins for an enhanced development experience.

The main goal is to build upon NvChad's solid foundation while keeping the customization layer minimal. This setup **respects NvChad's convention of separating custom configurations**, ensuring that the structure remains clean and easy to maintain.

---

## Installation

This configuration is based on NvChad. Before proceeding, ensure you have the necessary prerequisites installed.

### Prerequisites

- **Neovim v0.11+**
- **A Nerd Font** as your terminal font.
  - Make sure the nerd font you set doesn't end with `Mono` to prevent small icons.
  - Example: `JetbrainsMono Nerd Font` and not `JetbrainsMono Nerd Font Mono`.
- **`ripgrep`** is required for grep searching with Snacks Picker (OPTIONAL).
  - **Debian/Ubuntu**: `sudo apt-get install ripgrep`
  - **macOS (Homebrew)**: `brew install ripgrep`
  - **Arch Linux**: `sudo pacman -S ripgrep`
  - **Other**: See the [ripgrep installation guide](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation).
- **`fd`** is recommended for faster file searching (OPTIONAL).
  - **Debian/Ubuntu**: `sudo apt-get install fd-find`
  - **macOS (Homebrew)**: `brew install fd`
  - **Arch Linux**: `sudo pacman -S fd`
- **`gcc`**:
  - Windows users must have `mingw` installed and set on path.
- **`make`**:
  - Windows users must have `GnuWin32` installed and set on path.
- **`mise` or `asdf`**: For managing tool versions (optional, but recommended).
  - Follow the official instructions at the [mise website](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html) or the [asdf website](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) to install it.
- **`delve`** (for Go debugging): Required for debugging Go applications.
  - **Installation**: `go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@latest`
  - Make sure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your PATH.
  - See the [Delve installation guide](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/master/Documentation/installation) for more details.

Before installation, make sure to delete your old Neovim folders:

```bash
# For Linux/macOS
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim
```

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/clifinger/nvim-for-dev.git ~/.config/nvim
    ```

2. **Launch Neovim**:

    Open Neovim. The plugins will be installed automatically on the first run.

    ```bash
    nvim
    ```

3. **Install Tools**:

    Run the `:MasonInstallAll` command after `lazy.nvim` finishes downloading plugins to install all the necessary LSPs, formatters, and linters.

## Update

To update the configuration and plugins, use the `Lazy sync` command.
